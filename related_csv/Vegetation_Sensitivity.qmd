  <title>projects.SDE.PROJ_SMMNA_Veg_Sensitivity_Combined</title>
  <abstract>These layers come from Aspen Environmental Group (AEG), grouped by their sensitivity rankings (1 being most sensitive, and 4 being least sensitive). This is served in a Web Mapping appllication for the Santa Monica Mountains North Area Plan (click here). This is a combination of three pieces of data provided by AEG:
Vegetation and landcover data in the Santa Monica Mountains was combined with slope attributes - contains S1 - S4 rankings per the State of CA Fish and Wildlife (for more info, click here)
Critical Habitat areas for federal / state listed threatened or endangered species - ranked as 'S1'
Buffered streams (from the National Hydrography Dataset) - ranked all as 'S1'
UPDATE HISTORY:
9/26/19 - Topology test was run and it was found that in several areas the 'S3' and 'S4' polygons were overlapping....for these overlaps, the 'S4' was deleted. This was fixed and an ACRES field was added.
10/1/19 - received a new dataset from AEG. No overlaps were found, and it now has a 'Comment' field that displays the type of S1-S4 categories (Stream buffer, Critical Habitat, and Vegetation). Additionally, the new dataset conforms to the most recent Coastal Zone boundary.
6/10/21 - Exploded multi-part polygonts to improve online drawing performance in app.
